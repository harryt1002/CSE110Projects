        <h2>Group Bounding Activity</h2>
        <p>During our meeting we took the time to get to know a little about each other by participating in group bonding activities. We all shared our year and major as well as games that we enjoy playing on our spare time. We then played the browser game Skribble.io that allowed us to share our creative and fun side.</p>

        <h2>Role Delegation</h2>
        <p>The Team Leaders presented the rest of the group with their assigned roles for the project.</p>

        <h2>Indivdual Brainstorm</h2>
        <p>The group briefly discussed what ideal projects we would like to create if there were no restrictions in place. This brainstorming activity allowed each memeber to show their areas of interests when it comes to making a SWE based project.</p>

        <h2>Group Brainstorm</h2>
        <p>Following our individual brainstorming session, the group was unable to discuss and brainstorm an idea that we all enjoyed and agreed upon due to time restrictions. We can continue this point of discussion as the first item on the agenda for the next group meeting.</p>

        <h2>Upcoming Group Homework Assignments</h2>
        <p>On Canvas, it is to note that the group will have an assignment that covers a group kickoff meeting and the intialization of a group GitHub repo.</p>
        <div><h4>Things to Discuss Are:</h4></div>
            <ul>
                <li>Defining Roles</li>
                <li>Rules of Development</li>
                <li>Developing Team Contract</li>
                <li>Team GitHub Repo Initialization</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Future Group Bonding Activities</h2>
        <p>While project details and guidelines are still being announced, we should take the time to get to know each other better via group extracurricular activities. For the team to trust each other and maximize efficiency, we should be comfortable working alongside each other without this sense of awkwardness. For our next group meeting, we should discuss other group bonding acitivies we can partake in to continue strengthening our bond as a team.</p>

        <h2>Important Meeting Images</h2>
