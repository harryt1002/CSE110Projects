### My Personal Life
Hello, my name is Harry Tang and this is a look inside my personal life. I am a 20 year old Computer Engineer major at UCSD.
When I'm in my free time and not coding I typically enjoy playing video games such as **Valorant**. ***I really enjoy playing video games.***
And here is a link to the game's website if you were interested [Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/). 
I also really enjoy running and have started to go to the gym again in hopes of taking care of both my physical and mental health.
>"Exercise not only changes your body, it changes your mind, your attitude and your mood".

So being able to workout frequently really allows me to take a break from my assignments and presents me perhaps a new angle to
approach my problems.

### My Programmer Life
When it comes to programming I'm usually afraid of the task since I'm not too confident in my coding and programmer skills. However, that does
not mean I'm afraid to learn and I'm willing to take the time to research and understand the topic. For example, I was unfamiliar with the git 
commands such as:
```
git add
git branch
git checkout
```
but nonetheless I took the time to learn and understand it so I could be prepared for future applications of git.

Some languages I have touched on before are:
- Java
- JavaScript
- Python
- C
- C++

And future companies I would like to work for are:
1. Riot Games
2. Twitter
3. Facebook
4. JP Morgan Chase
5. Amazon

I am also working on applying to internship for this coming summer so there are still couple of things I need to do:
- [ ] Finalize my resume
- [ ] Practice LeetCode problems
- [ ] Apply to companies
