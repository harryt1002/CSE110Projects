### My Personal Life
Hello, my name is Harry Tang and this is a look inside my personal life. I am a 20 year old Computer Engineer major at UCSD.
When I'm in my free time and not coding I typically enjoy playing video games such as **Valorant**. ***I really enjoy playing video games.*** 
I also really enjoy running and have started to go to the gym again in hopes of taking care of both my physical and mental health.

So being able to workout frequently really allows me to take a break from my assignments and presents me perhaps a new angle to
approach my problems.
